These files will make it possible to run jsdoc-toolkit on NodeJS. Simply place
them in your original jsdoc-toolkit folder an execute with

	node  jsdoc-toolkit/app/run.node.js --help

For more info about NodeJS, visit http://nodejs.org/

Only three files where edited
	* run.js		--> run.node.js
	* main.js 		--> main.node.js
	* test.js		--> test.node.js (there was a bug on line 1)


Changes to run.js
-----------------

run.js did undergo some drastic changes to its IO object to support NodeJS. Some
changes where also required in the SYS object. Overall, I see no reason to share
run.js between Rhino and NodeJS since the differences are to great.

A function called IO.join was added to address the issue of joining two paths. 
The global function load() was marked as depricated (use IO.require() instead). 
SYS.javaHome and SYS.userDir where also marked as depricated since they serve no
function.


Changes to main.js
------------------

main.js required some changes. But there should be no problem sharing main.js
between both Rhino and NodeJS after some modifications.


Changes to test.js
------------------

test.js seemd to contain a bug on line 1 where it tried to load 
'app/frame/Dumper.js' which would fail. It was changed to 'frame/Dumper.js' 
instead.
